Hey folks! This week, we're gonna focus on getting some passing familiarity with ROS2.

* First things first, read through the [ROS2 Concepts Overview](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Concepts/#conceptshome) (it's a quick read, I promise). If you only do one thing this week for Rover, make it reading and really digesting this.
  * Reading the links at the top is optional, but certainly worthwhile.
  * There will probably be some stuff that you might not fully understand, but that's totally alright! We'll get there.
* Next week, we're gonna be doing the "Beginner" Tutorials from [here](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/), starting with CLI Tools. If you'd like, you can get a headstart (I'd especially recommend trying out the [Introducing turtlesim and rqt](https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Tutorials/Turtlesim/Introducing-Turtlesim/) tutorial in your local setup before hand, to make sure your development environment is working properly).
* If you don't want to build the docker container yourself, I've pushed a fresh build to both `luckierdodge/ros2_foxy:latest` and `niurover/ros2_foxy:latest`. So you can just use `launch.sh` in the Dockerfiles repo immediately after cloning, and it'll pull the latest image.
