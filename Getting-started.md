# Getting Started

Alright, here's some first steps to get ready for the NIU Rover "crash course in how to be a robotics developer"

1. If you're on Windows, install [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). When you get to step 6, get [Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6). Also, we recommend installing and using the [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N0DX20HK701). Install Git in WSL by running `sudo apt install -y git` and entering your password.
1. If you're on Mac, familiarize yourself with how to open the Terminal (it's in the Launchpad, under Utilities, I believe). Also, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) on your host operating system (i.e. Windows or MacOS, not in WSL).
1. Take a gander through our [Git & GitHub Crash Course](https://github.com/NIURoverTeam/RoverCoreOS/wiki/Git-&-GitHub-Crash-Course).
1. Read this article: [What is Docker?](https://dev.to/javascriptcoff1/what-is-docker-3be2).
